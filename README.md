This is a rewrite of one of the front-ends into Vue 3, this was requested by the project lead as I discovered at some point that the previous version found at:
https://github.com/KazWar/SBJ-front-end-init

Wasn't running on Vue 3 but Vue 2 instead, something that the previous front-end devs said it was. This version uses a hybrid data model with transformations from something that was poorly scalable and not well thought out to a new data model(Which I made redesigns for, further approved by the tech lead). This hybrid model gets scrapped in the https://github.com/KazWar/SBJ-front-end-ver2 of the site due to shifts in planning.
